    <h6>WHY</h6>
    <h3>Why is Sofia Coppola my favorite movie director?</h3>
    <p>Sofia Coppola is my favorite movie director because of her versatility - she can write and direct original stories from so many different genres. It’s also rare for a female movie director in Hollywood to have the power that she has to work with any actor that she wants, and to tell any story that she wants. She’s won prizes at top film festivals, sometimes the first woman to do so, and breaks down barriers for female filmmakers everywhere!</p>

        <h5>Lost in Translation</h5>
        <p>This film is about Bob, an American actor in Tokyo having a midlife crisis, who meets a young American woman called Charlotte. We see them strike up a strange and fun relationship.</p>
        <h5>Release</h5>
        <p>September 12, 2003</p>
        <h5>What I like about?</h5>
        <p>This is a film about people being alienated - from other people, from their location. It’s sometimes surreal, sometimes
        funny and very original.</p>

        <h5>The Bling Ring</h5>
        <p>A group of high-school students begins breaking into the homes of major celebrities to rob them of millions of dollars in clothes, shoes and jewellery.
        Based on a true story!</p>
        <h5>Release</h5>
        <p>June 14, 2013</p>
        <h5>What I like about?</h5>
        <p>Even though the characters are doing terrible things, Coppola lets the audience form our own judgements. I like movies
        that don’t patronize.</p>
